# Simple-Interpreter
NOTE:This is prealpha 0.0.1 version of interpreter. DO NOT USE IT.
The goal of this repository is to create simply interpreter alowing to see the execution state of program(in C) across interpreter step.
At eatch step only one bytecode is executed and evry bytecode is connected to source(no optimalization or maby in future some 'invisible' optymalization)

The current version uses BBcode which are build in Godot to show user whitch bytecode is executed, but has no can not parse some C expressions.
